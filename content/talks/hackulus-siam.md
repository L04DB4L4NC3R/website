Hackulus was a 24hr hackathon organised by Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM VIT). The event had multiple tracks and saw participants from all parts of the country. It aimed to spotlight unique and innovative ideas to real world problems within 24 hrs of constant mentorship and guidance by experts in leading technical domains such as Web development, App development and Machine Learning. It also aims to provide an opportunity to beginners who are not familiar with hackathons by providing a separate beginner round.
