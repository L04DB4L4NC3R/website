This event is was something which happens in a college on a daily basis, not a hack-a-thon, not a workshop but a full fledged placement mock which will help the students to crack the actual placements and bag dream offers. This was a 3 day power packed event, mocking the exact details of an on-campus placement procedure. 

Day 1 was a coding round which consisted of problem-solving, debugging and aptitude questions. On day 2 all the qualified students from Day 1 were called for the technical interview round. Then, Day 3 was HR + technical rounds of all the qualified candidates from Day 2.

I was invited in the interview panel and took technical as well as HR related interviews for the qualified participants.
